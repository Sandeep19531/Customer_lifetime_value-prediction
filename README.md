# Customer_lifetime_value-prediction
## About  
In this project I have trained a ML model to predict lifetime value of customers and divided them into 3 categories :  
  Gold,  
  Silver   
  and Bronze.  
For better accuracy I have tune hyper parameters of multiple classification models and choose the best among them. Elbow method was used for K-means clustering. Finally tuned version of xgboost model is used with 88.9% accuracy.
